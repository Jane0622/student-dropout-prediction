# Student Dropout Prediction

A Jupyter Notebook project predicting student dropout risk using regression and clustering techniques. This project was completed as part of the Business Data Science and Analytics graduate program at Angelo State University.

## Setup & Dependencies

To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jane0622/student-dropout-prediction.git
   cd student-dropout-prediction
````

*Note: This project was developed and run using Google Colab, so dependencies are managed within the notebook.*

## Repository Structure

```
student-dropout-prediction/
├── Project_Final_Report.ipynb     # Final notebook with full analysis
├── README.md                      # Project description and documentation

## Data Source

The dataset includes student academic performance, attendance, and resource usage. Data was provided for academic purposes and cleaned for analysis within the notebook.

## Project Highlights

* **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Missing values handled and features engineered for analysis.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Correlation matrix, distribution plots, and outlier detection.
* **Regression Models**: Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, and Logistic Regression.
* **Classification and Clustering**: Decision Tree Classifier and KMeans Clustering to identify patterns in student success and dropout rates.
* **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

## Usage

To view the analysis and results, open `Project_Final_Report.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or view it directly in GitHub.

## Conclusion & Next Steps

The model helped identify potential dropout risks using behavioral and academic indicators. For future improvements, we suggest tuning model parameters, experimenting with ensemble methods, and deploying an interactive dashboard for early intervention support.
