# Student Dropout Prediction â€“ Group Project

This project was completed as part of the Business Data Science and Analytics graduate program at Angelo State University. The objective was to use historical student data to identify patterns that contribute to dropout risk and to develop predictive models that can support early intervention efforts.

## Project Overview

We analyzed student academic behavior and resource usage data to predict the likelihood of student success or dropout. The project involved data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, regression modeling, and unsupervised learning techniques.

## Key Components

- **Project_Final_Report.ipynb**: Final Jupyter Notebook containing all code, visualizations, and analysis.
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Handling missing values, standardizing data types, and feature engineering.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualizations and correlations to understand the dataset.
- **Regression Models**: Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, and Logistic Regression to predict dropout probability.
- **Classification and Clustering**: Decision Tree and KMeans Clustering to identify at-risk students.
- **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix were used to assess performance.

## Technologies Used

- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook (via Google Colab)

## Team Members

- Jane Ha (Data Visualization, Final Report Integration)
- Aaron Alacar
- Alinsandra Lorn
